# 🔄 Customer Churn Analysis (Python + Pandas + Visualization)

This project performs an end-to-end **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on a telecom customer churn dataset. The goal is to identify key factors influencing customer churn and generate insights that can drive business decisions around customer retention.

📊 Built entirely in Python using **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn**, enhanced with meaningful visualizations and data storytelling.
