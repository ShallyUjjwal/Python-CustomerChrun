# 🔄 Customer Churn Analysis (Python + Pandas + Visualization)

This project performs an end-to-end **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on a telecom customer churn dataset. The goal is to identify key factors influencing customer churn and generate insights that can drive business decisions around customer retention.

📊 Built entirely in Python using **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn**, enhanced with meaningful visualizations and data storytelling.

- **Customer demographics**: gender, senior citizen status, partner, dependents  
- **Service usage**: internet, phone, streaming services  
- **Billing info**: monthly charges, total charges, contract type  
- **Churn label**: Yes/No
